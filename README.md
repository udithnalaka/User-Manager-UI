This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## run the application locally
npm start

## following components are created
* App - parent container
* Header - just a header (functional component)
* CreateUser - form to create a user.
* ListUser - list all users
* Footer - just a footer (functional component)

## Notes
* I have used class components where state needs to be managed
* Actions.js file has all the API calls. (currently not integrated with the backend).
* users.json file was created for locally loading the data.
